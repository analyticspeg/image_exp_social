Ingredients: 
-2 large eggplants (or as we say, jumbo.. way too big eggplants) 
-olive oil
-salt 
-Marinara (or you can use store-bought, eww): 3ish tbsp olive oil, 1/2cup finely chopped yellow onion, 5 minced garlic cloves, salt, pepper, 28oz can whole tomatoes, 1 sprig of basil
-Ricotta Filling: 1cup ricotta, 1/2cup packed grated parmesan, 2tbsp chopped basil, 1 egg, 2 grated garlic cloves, 1tsp red chili flakes, salt and pepper 
-shredded mozzarella and Parm for the top
-Toppings (optional): toasted pine nuts, basil 

Recipe: 
-To a medium sized pot on medium heat add olive oil and onions. Season generously with salt and pepper. Let cook for 3-4 min. Once starting to soften add garlic.

-Preheat oven to 400F 
-thinly slice eggplant to 1/4inch. should have 12-14 slices. cover both sides generously with salt. The salt helps bring out the moisture, removes bitterness and softens the eggplant.

Let them fully cool before rolling
